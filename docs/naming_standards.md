# Naming Standards

Naming is hard, and effort put into meaningful and readable names will pay dividends long after the project is finished.

In general, we stick with the idioms of the language we are using. If something is missing from this standard, refer to Google guidelines for the relevant language.
Also, avoid abbreviations except for a small set of agreed abbreviations such as "id" instead of "identifier". Older platforms, such as Teradata, have name length restrictions (30 characters), which resulted in complex, variably consistent, organisation-specific abbreviation schemes.


## Files

* Filenames use all lowercase with underscores to separate words.
* Columns headers also use all lowercase with underscores to separate words.

## SQL

* Comma-first when separating columns by line.

## Scala
